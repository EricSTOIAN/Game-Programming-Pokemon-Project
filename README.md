# Pokemon School Project âš¡

<p>This project I recently completed was part of my many assignments from John Abbott College. Having been giving some starter code by one of my teachers to work with, I was able to finish this small game and it is one of the more fun assignments I've had to do.</p>

## Desciption
<p>This small version of Pokemon, the user starts off with a main screen, where by pressing the enter key, fades in and out into a small map where by stepping on certain tiles of the map, a 10% chance of getting into a battle.</p>

### Battle State
<p>The battle state starts off by saying that a wild Pokemon has appeared. Wow! You get transported into the battle grounds and face off against either Bulbasaur, Squirtle or Charmander, while you yourself having either one of these pokemon. Both pokemon have health bars that
decrease with every hit, and the user's pokemon even has an experience bar, showing how far it is from leveling up, which gives it better stats for speed, attack, defense and health. These statistics are all randomly generated within a range, depending on the pokemon's level.</p>
